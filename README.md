Simple Line Editor for BeamNG.drive

Feedback is always welcome, more features to come.

#### Current known bugs:
- Not automatically add .track.json to file names.

#### List of features I would like to add:
- toggable line
- option to apply current speedup values
- a proper help page

### v0.2
Added the functionallity to move individual nodes. 
Speedup parts of the line.

### v0.1.1
Added a more pleasant GUI, including a graph showing all the points of the selected line

### v0.1
* Select input and output file<sup>1</sup>
* Change the speed based on a percentage<sup>2</sup>

1 - If you want a file in the same directory, but don't want to browse again switch the "Set input to output" checkbox on and off. This will set the file path of the input to the output, you can then edit output filename.  
2 - Use negative percentages to slowdown the line
